{"name":"Ai-project","tagline":"NXC Code for my recent robotics assignment.","body":"### 1. The Challenge\r\nThis is the offical page for the COSC343 first AI project for Nick Dowse and Andrew Ashton. The task was to program lego mindstorm robots in NXC to complete a course as shown below. First the robot had to start, turn 90 degrees, then travel forward over to a black tile, then turn and travel over 14 black tiles, interspersed with white tiles. It then had to turn again and travel over a distance of 7 large grey tiles, before stopping on the finish line.\r\n\r\n![Assignment Task]\r\n(https://www.dropbox.com/s/4spst2dlqcns5lt/Screenshot%202014-10-14%2021.42.27.png?dl=0)\r\n\r\nThe second part of the assignment was to write a report about the challenges involved, the processes used, and what you learnt (posted at the bottom of the page).\r\n\r\n### 2. The Code\r\n\r\nThe code was broken up into 5 main parts. The first part calibrates the light sensor to recognise the correct colour value for black and the correct colour value for white. The code below loops through until both left and right buttons (`Sensor(IN_3)` and `Sensor(IN_2)`) have been clicked, capturing the light value at the time they were clicked as black and white respectively. Once the light values have been calibrated the screen prints out the average value, and we are ready to start.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntask calibrate_sensors(){\r\n  int hasBeenCalibrated = 0;\r\n  while (hasBeenCalibrated < 2){\r\n    if (Sensor(IN_3) && hasBeenCalibrated == 0){\r\n      black = Sensor(IN_1);\r\n      hasBeenCalibrated = 1;\r\n      ClearScreen();\r\n      TextOut(0, 32, \"B \" + NumToStr(black));\r\n    }\r\n    if (Sensor(IN_2) && hasBeenCalibrated == 1){\r\n      white = Sensor(IN_1);\r\n      hasBeenCalibrated = 2;\r\n      ClearScreen();\r\n      TextOut(0, 32, \"W \" + NumToStr(white));\r\n      Wait(2000);\r\n    }\r\n    if (hasBeenCalibrated == 2){\r\n      average = (black + white) / 2;\r\n      ClearScreen();\r\n      TextOut(0, 32, \"A \" + NumToStr(average));\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
